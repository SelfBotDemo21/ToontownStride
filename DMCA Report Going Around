Hello, 

There is this DMCA report post going around and shutting down copies of Toontown Stride.
It was made by this github user called Hubot (Hew-Bot) |Which is a bot for github.|
I will leave a link so you can view the DMCA report made by Hubot.

They might take down this open source TTS also. But I'm pretty sure it will stay up because it's from 2015, and hasnt been taken down yet.
So, I bet this one will stay up

But. Good luck

Thanks,
A Github User
